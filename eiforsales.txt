Emotional Intelligence for Sales Success is a fascinating book with many tools that can be added to your arsenal. The following are three takeaways I have implemented.


1.     Set a “give goal” and aim to provide value five times a week. Giving can be sending a useful article, writing a recommendation, or showing appreciation. Helping others grow strengthens relationships. Are you a giver or a taker?


2.     Master your emotions: Get it done regardless of how you feel. Reflect on your actions regularly to avoid repeating mistakes and stay calm in the eye of the storm.


3.     Ask numerous questions: Listen more, talk less. Learn about their story as if you’re writing their autobiography. Learn what a day in their life looks like and use empathy by being genuinely interested in the other person.


The only time you can afford not to change, grow, or improve is when your competition has made the same decision. What strategies have helped you grow?
