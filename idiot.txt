“Idiots who surround you are, in fact, not idiots at all. Instead, they are individuals worthy of respect, understanding, and being valued.” -Thomas Erikson


💡In Surrounded by Idiots, Erikson emphasizes learning human psychology is an important subject to master because we all interact with diverse personalities every day.


💯 With this system you won’t have to guess others’ behaviors. While only 5% of people are predominantly one color, and 80% of people are a blend of two. The key is knowing your own color first, then adapting your style to meet others’ communication preferences. This simple shift will automatically make you a more effective communicator and avoid unnecessary conflict.


🧠 Learning to understand human behavior is like a new language and it’s a life-long journey worth pursuing.

One thing I learned that changed my perspective on others is that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. No one is an idiot or weird, they just have different strengths and weaknesses than you.
