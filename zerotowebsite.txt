From Zero to Website: a Week-long Journey into Web Development
When I started this project, terms like CSS, JavaScript, and coding were completely foreign to me. But I decided to dive in headfirst, using AI as my guide to understand the fundamentals of web development.

What did I learn? Your vision is more important than the path to get there. With the right tools and resources, learning how to execute an idea has never been more accessible, especially with AI on your side.

The hardest part is getting started. After that the journey becomes an exciting adventure.
