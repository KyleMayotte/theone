“None of us got to where we are alone. Whether the assistance we received was obvious or subtle, acknowledging someone’s help is a big part of understanding the importance of saying thank you.” -Harvey Mackay 

Swim with the sharks without being eaten alive is a foundational reading on networking and success, recommended by several CEOs and used to be required in MBA programs. This book builds off many principles Dale Carnegie preaches, and helped me build upon my network. Harvey Mackay provides actionable steps to building meaningful long-term relationships. Here are some of his key strategies in 3 simple steps:
 
 1.      Don’t keep the score.
In order to succeed, start by helping others succeed by giving without expecting anything in return. This could be as simple as sending a handwritten card, leaving a thoughtful comment on social media, or reaching out with a message when you think of them. Mackay emphasizes sending out short notes as a way to foster long term connections.
 
 2.      The Mackay 66.
Networking can be overwhelming, so Harvey created the Mackay 66, a profile with 66 questions to understand his customers better. This organized approach helped him stay authentic by keeping track of customers’ interests and needs. Anyone can implement this to build a strong network by keeping track of their contacts’ interests and preferences by using excel. The more you know about them, the better relationship you will build.
 
 3.      Take initiative.
Over years of networking, Mackay observed a common trait that successful people share is the ability to actively create and nurture a network. He emphasized setting goals to give direction and making it a habit to engage and connect with others. Put yourself out there with iron determination and it will pay off in the long run.

Mackay ultimately reminds us that by helping others, we learn how to help ourselves. To stay anchored in this principle, consider this guiding question: How can I serve more?
