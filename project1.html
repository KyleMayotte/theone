    <h2>Building a Website with Zero Coding Experience</h2>
    <p>Before this project, I had never even heard of CSS, Java, or thought about coding. With that being said, I dove in head first using AI to guide me through what the coding language means and how to implement it.
        What did I learn? Your vision is more important than how you’ll get there. Learning how to do something is easier than ever, especially with an AI buddy. I started this project at the beginning of spring break and finished it within a week. This was a fun adventure and proof that the hardest part is getting started.
        That’s all. Carry on.
