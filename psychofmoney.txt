“Doing well with money has little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave.” -Morgan Housel


The Psychology of Money is an awesome book that has given me a deeper understanding of how money works in our economy. Here are 3 takeaways:


💯 Tail drives EVERYTHING: You can be wrong most of the time and still make a fortune. The smallest tail ends of distribution outcomes can have a monumental impact on business and finance. As Napoleon once said, “A genius is a man that does the average thing when everyone around him is going crazy”.  Keep moving forward until the odds fall in your favor.


🚀 Compound interest: Warren Buffet accumulated $81.5 Billion out of $84.5 billion after his 65th birthday (a figure that has skyrocketed to 146.2 billion since published). His greatest secret? Time.


💸 Wealth is what you don’t see: getting rich is one thing; staying rich is another. Wealth requires humility, self-control, and a degree of paranoia.


This book explains how soft skills are more important than ever in this hypercompetitive world. As technology continues evolving, mastering these skills is crucial for long-term success in finance, business, and life.
