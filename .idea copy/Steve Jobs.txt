Steve Jobs lived a fascinating life. Reading Isaacson’s biography on him has had a profound impact on the way I think and approach my goals. Here are three main takeaways I got from his intense lifestyle:


Reality distortion field: Steve would bend and mold reality to fit the purpose at hand and achieve the purpose at hand. He believed the only limitations we have are set by our own minds. Steve did not care if everyone else thought he was crazy because he knew anything is possible if you think big enough. 


Never fear failure: Steve was ousted from his own company, had many product disappointments, failed at NeXT and his legacy remains as a revolutionary and visionary that changed the world. Steve realized when one door closes another one opens. He was relentless and his ability to aim big and think differently drove him to success.


Obsession with perfection: Steve believed people do judge a book by its cover. He loved to do things the right way from museum quality packaging to mass marketing. Nearing the end of many of his projects he would gut and rebuild the entire thing from scratch accepting nothing other than perfection. He did not care how long it took and would restart it until it was. 


Steve encouraged people to think differently and challenge the status quo – bet your career on doing things a different way. Don’t just follow trends, create them. And as always “stay hungry, stay foolish”.
