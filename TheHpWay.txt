“More Businesses die from indigestion than starvation.” – David Packard


The HP Way is an insightful handbook for managers and anyone with entrepreneurial aspirations. David Packard and Bill Hewlett’s journey—from starting their business in a garage to creating the birthplace of Silicon Valley—is truly inspiring.


Key concepts David and Bill highly emphasized as part of The HP Way:


   ·      Profit sharing: Profit is the number one contributing factor to society and the ultimate source of corporate strength. At HP they prioritized sharing successes with the employees who made them possible, recognizing and encouraging everyone’s hard work. Sharing was a key principle at HP, and always important to bear in mind.


   ·      Decentralization: They promoted an environment of autonomy that fostered individual motivation, initiative, and creativity. This gave employees a wide latitude of freedom to work toward common goals and objectives. HP’s approach to decentralization has inspired me to adopt an open-door policy with my teammates to foster mutual trust.


   ·      Philanthropy: David Packard believed that “The betterment of our society is not a job to be left to a few; it is a responsibility to be shared by all.” His view of philanthropy as a personal duty and obligation has motivated me to actively volunteer in my community.


The HP Way offers timeless insights that continue to be relevant today. David and Bill built a transformational company while giving back and fostering a community that feels like family.
