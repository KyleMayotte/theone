The rule of 3’s
FACTS
MECES
(intuition)->Initial Hypothesis


The McKinsey Way is a seminal business book that teaches you how to think and solve business problems in a proficient manner. Here are three takeaways I got:


Analytical thinking: Start with the facts because they are the foundation and building blocks to support your hypothesis. Then structure your thinking by breaking down the problem into smaller components. Mckinsey uses a method called MECE – mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. Are all the solutions independent? and Have you thought of everything? Put it all together with an initial hypothesis including an issue tree (picture below).


Professionalism: The firm has a mantra chronological order: the client, the firm, you. Remember it’s always about the other person. Be honest, respect others, and preserve integrity. If you follow this principle everything else will fall into place as it should. 


Every problem has a solution: no matter how complex, irrational, or far-fetched a problem is – There is a solution. Dig deep. Find it.


I love doing quick synopsis on books I read so I can remember the main takeaways along with providing information to anyone that is interested. The book goes in much more depth and I recommend it to anyone that will need to solve problems in the future.
